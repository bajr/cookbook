## BBQ Brisket

#### Ingredients

* A packer brisket 8 to 15 lbs
* Salt
* Pepper
* 8oz Apple Juice
* Heavy duty foil
* Apple wood chunks (you can find this at home depot)

#### Directions

At least 12 hours before barbecuing coat your brisket with salt and pepper.
You want a nice even rub around the entire brisket. Once coated wrap in foil
and put in refrigerator.

In your barbecue build a small offset fire using enough apple wood chunks to
get consistent and constant smoke. Note that meat picks up more smoke flavor
when it is uncooked (raw) so you can give up on smoke in the later hours
of your barbecuing. You want to smoke the brisket at 225°F to 275°F until it
hits an internal temperature of at least 195°F but 203°F is even better.
This will probably take you at least 12 hours. If you want to shorten your
cook time you can "crutch" the brisket when it gets into the 140°F to 150°F
range, basically wrap your brisket in foil with the apple juice added in.
At this internal temperature the brisket's internal juices will evaporate
cooling the brisket. The crutch prevents this from happening and speeds up
the cooking process.

After many hours the brisket will reach the desired tenderness and internal
temperature, but you are not done yet. Pull the brisket off the heat and let
it rest in an insulated container. An oven or ice chest works well. Let rest
for at least an hour.

Cut and serve.
