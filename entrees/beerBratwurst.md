## Pan-Fried Beer Bratwurst

#### Ingredients:

* 24 fl oz beer (Lagers and ales are best. Stouts/Porters give bitter 'smoked' aftertaste. IPAs not recommended...)
* 4 bratwursts (whole)
* 1/2 large onion, sliced
* Garlic to taste
* 1 tbsp butter

#### Directions:
  1. Pour beer into large pot or deep skillet. Heat to light simmer.
  2. Add butter to melt.
  3. Add bratwursts, onion, and garlic. Cover and cook on low simmer for 30-45 minutes, turning bratwursts periodically.
  4. Reduce beer until it is sticky and syrupy. Use syrup to coat bratwursts.
  5. Serve with hotdog buns, pretzels, sauerkraut, and/or mustard
