## Indian Curry (Lamb)

#### Ingredients

* 1 lbs lamb (cubed)
* 2 tbls grease [1]
* 1 tbls oil [1]
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper (white)
* 1 medium onion (diced)
* 1 tbls curry powder
* 1 tbls paprika
* 1 cube boullion
* 1 cup hot water
* 1 cup rice
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1/2 cup peanuts (washed|unsalted)

[1] I use bacon grease and olive oil, but there's no reason this couldn't be
    entirely olive oil (or entirely bacon grease ;)

#### Directions

Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a paper bag and shake the lamb in the flour
mixture. Heat grease in a large skillet on medium heat. Brown breaded meat on
all sides. Save flour mixture. Add onion and oil to skillet and saut√©.
Add curry powder, paprika, boullion, hot water, and reduce heat to low. Simmer
for 45 minutes. Cook rice.  Add cooked rice, raisins, peanuts, and flour
mixture to skillet. Simmer 15 minutes.
