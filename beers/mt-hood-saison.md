## Mt Hood Saison

Note this beer is adapted from Jamil's Saison recipe to accomodate
Wyeast 3711's high attenuation and uses Mt Hood hops to give this
Belgian style French fermented beer a bit of Northwest too.

#### Ingredients

* 10lbs Pilsner Malt
* 0.75lbs Wheat Malt
* 0.75lbs Munich Malt
* 2.25oz Mt Hood Hops
* Wyeast 3711

#### Mash

Mash at 148째F for 60 minutes then sparge collecting enough wort that
you end up with 5.5 gallons of beer post boil. On my equipment I mash
in with 19 quarts of water at 159째F. Drain the mash tun then do a
single batch sparge with 20 quarts of 168째F water. This should yield
about 8 gallons of wort.

#### Boil

Boil wort for 75 minutes (do 90 if you are not impatient and have
enough wort to start with) adding the following hop additions:

* 60 minutes - 1.25oz Mt Hood Hops (Aim for 32 IBUs with this addition)
* 0 minutes - 1.0oz Mt Hood Hops

Chill quickly, strain hops and aerate prior to pitching yeast.

#### Fermentation

Start fermentation in around 68째F. Keep the temperature there for the first
48 hours of fermentation then let the naturally increase the tempurature
all the way up into the low to mid 80s. Raising the temp in this way should
give us lots of esters, pepper, and spice. Note this yeast will steadily
eat everything in your wort. Give it time and let it do its thing. Double
check SG before racking to a keg or bottling.

#### Numbers

* OG - 1.055
* SG - 1.007 (but possibly even lower, much lower)
* ABV - ~6.3%
* SRM - 4.6
* IBU - 32
