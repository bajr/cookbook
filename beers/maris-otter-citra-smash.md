## Maris Otter Citra SMaSH

#### Ingredients

* 12lbs Maris Otter
* 4oz Citra Hops
* Wyeast 1056, WLP001, or US-05 yeast

#### Mash

Mash at 153째F for 60 minutes then sparge collecting enough wort that
you end up with 5.5 gallons of beer post boil. On my equipment I mash
in with 17 quarts of water at 166째F. Drain the mash tun then do a
single batch sparge with 19 quarts of 168째F water. This should yield
about 7 gallons of wort.

#### Boil

Boil wort for 60 minutes adding the following hop additions:

* 60 minutes - 0.5oz Citra Hops (Aim for 25 IBUs with this addition)
* 15 minutes - 0.5oz Citra Hops
* 10 minutes - 0.25oz Citra Hops
* 5 minutes - 0.25oz Citra Hops
* 0 minutes - 0.5oz Citra Hops

Chill quickly, strain hops and aerate prior to pitching yeast.

#### Fermentation

Ferment at 65째F to keep the yeast neutral, we want the hops and grain
to come through. Primary fermentation will take approximately two weeks.
Once most activity has subsided add the remaining 2oz of Citra hops
to the fermenter to dry hop. Rack to keg after four days of dry hopping
and force carb.
