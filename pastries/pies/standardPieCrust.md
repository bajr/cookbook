## A Crust For All Pies

#### Ingredients:

* 2 cups ice water (1 - 1.5 cups cold water, filled with ice)
* 2.5 cups sifted flour (all-purpose is best)
* 1 tbsp sugar (omit for savory pies)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup chilled, unsalted "fat" [1], sliced into small pieces
* 

#### Directions
  1. Add flour, sugar, and salt to medium bowl. Be careful not to get the flour wet.
  2. Add "fat" to bowl.
  3. Mix *gently* with your hands. Rub fat between your fingers to incorporate *all* of the flour.
      Note: Flour will change color from white to a very light yellow. When finished, mixture should have a "pebbly" consistency. If dough feels soft, chill for 5 minutes and continue.
  4. Slowly add ice water. Toss flour with water. DO NOT KNEAD! Continue adding water and tossing dough until consitency is firm, resists crumbling, but does *not* feel wet.
      Note: To test doneness of dough, scoop a small amount of dough and roll into a ball. Toss ball in the air and allow to fall into your hand. If ball shatters, dough is too dry and needs water. If ball thumps and retains shape, it is ready. Dough should not feel wet!
  5. Roll dough into two (2) thick discs, wrapped individually in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour. 
      Note: Dough will keep for 3 days in fridge, 1 month in freezer.
  6. Keep dough chilled until ready to roll out into pie crust.

#### Notes
1. Butter, Lard, Shortening, Coconut Oil, etc. to taste Leaf Lard is best. Shortening makes a good, sturdy, flaky crust, at the cost of flavor.  Butter is flavorful, but less flaky.
